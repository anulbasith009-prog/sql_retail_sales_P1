-- 1. Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns for sales made on '2022-11-05:
	SELECT *
	FROM
		retail_sales
	WHERE sale_date = '2022-11-05';


-- 2. Write a SQL query to retrieve all transactions where the category is 'Clothing' and the quantity sold is more than 4 in the month of Nov-2022:

	SELECT *
	FROM	retail_sales
	WHERE category = 'Clothing' 
	AND
	TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM') = '2022-11'
	AND
	quantity >= 4;

--3. Write a SQL query to calculate the total sales (total_sale) for each category.:

	SELECT 
	category,
	SUM(total_sale) AS net_sale,
	COUNT(*) AS total_orders
	FROM retail_sales
	GROUP BY 1;

-- 4. Write a SQL query to find the average age of customers who purchased items from the 'Beauty' category.:

	SELECT
	ROUND(AVG(age), 2) AS average_age
	FROM retail_sales
	WHERE category = 'Beauty'

-- 5. Write a SQL query to find all transactions where the total_sale is greater than 1000.:

	SELECT
	*
	FROM
	retail_sales
	WHERE total_sale > 1000


-- 6. Write a SQL query to find the total number of transactions (transaction_id) made by each gender in each category.:

	gender,
	COUNT(transactions_id) AS total_trans
	FROM
	retail_sales
	GROUP BY
	gender,category
	ORDER BY
	1;

-- --7. Write a SQL query to calculate the average sale for each month. Find out best selling month in each year:

	SELECT * FROM
	
		(SELECT
	EXTRACT (YEAR FROM sale_date) AS year,
	EXTRACT (MONTH FROM sale_date) AS month,
	AVG(total_sale) as Avg_sale,
	RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date)ORDER BY AVG(total_sale)desc) AS RANK
	FROM retail_sales
	GROUP BY 1,2) 
	
	as t1 WHERE rank = 1

-- 8. **Write a SQL query to find the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales **:

	SELECT 
		customer_id,
		SUM(total_sale) AS total_sales
	FROM retail_sales

--10. Write a SQL query to create each shift and number of orders (Example Morning <12, Afternoon Between 12 & 17, Evening >17):
WITH hourly_sale
AS
	( SELECT *,
	    CASE
		WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) <  12 THEN 'Morning'
		WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
        ELSE 'Evening'
 END as shift
	FROM retail_sales )

	SELECT
